# Arma-3-Dynamic-Artillery-Pieces-Script v1.0
>*Dependencies: none.*

DAP is an Arma 3 script that allows the Mission Editor (you) to create real (or virtual) artillery/mortar fire missions faster and smarter for one or multiple sides, using Eden markerâ€™s positions and an external fire missions list where you plan the caliber, ammo type, rounds, cycle of repetition and more.
